# Project Name : Driver's License

## Concept

Obtaining a driver's license for the first time is an exciting milestone that comes with a sense of freedom. The busy roads, formerly unattainable, suddenly transforms to an exciting opportunity. Motivated by this, we have made the decision to develop a racing game. In this game, players assume the role of newly licensed drivers as they race through a variety of obstacles and experience both the excitement and anxiety of driving for the first time.

 Our goal is to apply important ideas from our course on computer graphics, like texture mapping and realistic lighting, to create an immersive and thrilling experience.

## Features

We want to build features into our game to give a fun and realistic experience for the users.  Here are some of them:
- **Race Track** : The race track will represent real-world driving environments to simulate the experience of a first-time driver. We will implement smooth and sharp curves, elevation changes, and obstacles, requiring players to demonstrate their driving skills. 
- **Sky Box** : A skybox will be implemented to create immersive backgrounds for the game, providing a realistic atmosphere. Depending on the time, the skybox will display different times of day (morning, afternoon, dusk, night). The lighting of the environment will change according to the skybox, affecting shadows and reflections for a more authentic driving experience.
- **Water reflection**: Water elements, such as lakes, rivers, or puddles on the road after rain, will incorporate realistic reflections. 
- **Vehicle Physics and Controls** : Players will control vehicles with realistic handling characteristics, reflecting the experience of a driver. The game will incorporate realistic physics for acceleration, braking, and collisions, giving players a feel for the challenges of driving.
- **Difficulty Levels** : Players will be able to choose from various difficulty levels, providing better experience for beginners. The difficulty setting will adjust the AI performance when racing against the users.

## Technologies/Tools used

- **Unity 3D** : Unity is a popular choice for many project and widely used for its cross platform support, user friendly interface, and high performance for 3d rendering also with a rich asset store.
- **Visual Studio** : Visual studio is a powerful IDE for complex projects also for writing C# code in Unity.
- **Github** : Github is ideal for maging project such as, tracks code changes, supports for teamwork, and offers a central place for all files.
